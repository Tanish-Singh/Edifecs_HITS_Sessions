//     System.out.println("Hello World");
// }
// now as you run this code this will give an error like where is your class, 
// beacuse java is an object oriented programming , Hence in the language everything needs to be like
// an object for which we need a class


// lets create a class then

class first_pro{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello Edifecs");//(these you can use print which will print in the same
        // line hence println will auto jump to the nextline)
    }
}

// after you run this the code will work properly
// now you see there is a class file is created which is the bytecode created by the compiler

// to run directly from compiler you can
